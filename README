Data Plane Device Management (DPDM) framework includes a set of user-space libraries (FreeBSD license)
and a kernel module (GPL license), vni.ko. A DPDK application built with DPDM user-space libraries would
enable the application to use traditional network management tools, such as ethtool, ip, ifconfig etc,
to manage NIC devices which are bound with user-space DPDK device drivers.

The DPDM user-space libraries are libraries based upon DPDK libraries, and they provide additional
device-neutral APIs to support device management capabilities, mainly functions equivalent to kernel
Netdev ops and a set of SR-IOV management functions. A high-level overview of DPDM can be found at
dpdm/doc/DPDM.pdf

To build DPDM user-space libraries, it requires 
1. Creating four environment variables
		a. RTE_SDK/RTE_TARGET: these two variables are used for locating DPDK build
		b. RTE_SDKEX: path for DPDM source code.
		c. VNI_NETDEV: path for vni source code

2. run dpdm/build_all.sh: 
	#cd dpdm
	#./build_all.sh

To build DPDM kernel module, vni.ko.
	#cd vni
	#make

To build an application with DPDM, please refer to dpdm/examples/test-vni/README

To instaniate DPDM kernel module, vni.ko.
	#insmod vni/vni.ko

After vni.ko is installed, below sys files are created for debug, tracking and others.
	- /sys/kernel/vni_manage/client_cache: used for user-space DPDM library to return VFD get-statistic result
																				when working with ethtool
	- /sys/kernel/vni_manage/get_stats_en: used by customer to turn on/off Netdev get-statistics
	- /sys/kernel/vni_manage/trace: latest 4K debug message for kernel and user-space Netlink activities
